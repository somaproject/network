RXoutput fifo test:

To deal with memory buffer wrap-around, we shall create multiple ram files:

ram.0.low.dat
ram.0.high.dat
ram.1.low.dat
ram.1.high.dat

which will be sequentially loaded. 

We have the "correct" output as a list of output frames (data.dat) with:

0 100 0123 AB12 CF84 ...

where 0 is the number of ticks to wait with NEXTFRAME low

and 100 is the number of DATAEN=high to wait, thus by setting this
number less than the total length of the frame we can abort early and
check for recovery.

The remaining data on the line is the data valid in the frame. 

 we will increment the base pointers with bp.dat, which is read as:

malim bpin

i.e. when MA >= malim then set BPIN = bpin
