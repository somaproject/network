GMIIin test suite

Variables to check: 

Minimum frame size

Minimum distance between frames

does RX_ER on the last byte in a frame get detected? what about first byte? 

check overflow: write n bytes with other interface stalled. 

random testing? 

Our input vector is a list of RX_ERR, RX_DV, RXD of the form
RXD RX_DV RX_ER

Our verify form is just a series of two-byte words expected to match.
