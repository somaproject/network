A simulation to test the TXinput capability. 

Things to check:

What happens when we write frames where the length word is :
1. Correct
2. too big
3. too small

what happens when the NEWFRAME signal goes low mid-transmit? 

How does the sytem handle FIFOFULL signals. Correctly? 

Does the system properly reset on RESET? 

Proposed test method: use python code to generate a series of input vectors and an expected ram writes / BP values. Double writes won't cause an error, because really, they have no real impact. VHDL code will guarantee that all values are constant for at least 4 ticks. 

Base pointers are a bit more tricky -- we'll tie these to 4 real cycles after new-frame going low. Thus we have a list of "expected base pointers" 

The resulting python model will be a virtually complete model of the entire subsystem. 

BPs.writes.dat : base pointers
RAM.writes.dat : list of expected ram writes
din.dat : input DIN and NEWFRAME sequence

memdata: every four ticks (simulate CE) if MWE is high and MWE is not equal to before, we compare to the file...
