Control test....


This is the control test... this is sufficiently complex that we're going to do it all in vhdl...

Components to check:


Can we write/read back from:

mac-receive-dependent registers:
   MACADDR, RXBCAST, RXMCAST, RXUCAST, RXALLF

external LEDs: do we go high for the proper duration? 

Counters: do we accurately count? can we read out the errors?

PHY: We have a simulated PHY, and we set certain values for the LINK_AN and 1KSCR register
