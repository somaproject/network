This is a simple test to measure the signal integrity of our external
board-to-board interface.

Here we simply take all of the input bits, clock them in with an IOB
reg, clock them out with an IOB reg, and then are done with it. It's
up to the device (host) interfaced with the nic to generate and verify
a bit-pattern.

The bit mappings are:

DIN[15:0] => DOUT[15:0]
NEXTFRAME => DOUTEN; 
NEWFRAME => DINEN; 
SERCLK => SO
SI => SCS; 


By my calculations we should have two ticks of latency here.
