This is a very basic test of the phy; we instantiate the controller,
and we also generate a simple packet-tx interface. 

We just load a block ram with packet data and then simply send it out
once every 100 ms.

USER1 vs USER2:

The USER1 instruction writes in the serial bits; USER2 is used to read them out.

phyparse.py: 

* to test: 
1. bring phy out of reset: 

[jonas@shannon phytest]$ sudo python phyparse.py write 1 1
~/XC3Sprog/xc3sprog 0 0x02 "01 00 00 00 82"

2. write "phy dout word":
[jonas@shannon phytest]$ sudo python phyparse.py write 9 1140
~/XC3Sprog/xc3sprog 0 0x02 "40 11 00 00 89"

3. write the "phy addr register" to start the command: 
[jonas@shannon phytest]$ sudo python phyparse.py write 8 20
~/XC3Sprog/xc3sprog 0 0x02 "20 00 00 00 88"

and then check for packets!

note that the packet sent is not a valid IP packet but simply an empty ethernet frame with a valid FCS.
