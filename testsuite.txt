The NIC test jig for VHDL and results...

The goal of the test code is to make sure we can successfully:
1. download rawbits to the FPGA
2. make sure the memory interface has all necessary pins connected, and can actually work at our desired speed. 
3. send one pkt over and over and over. 
4. Flash das blinkenlights


To do this, we basically wire up the memory controller to do the following:
on chan 1, write in bytes
on chan 2, read in bytes
The reader thread will follow the writing thread by some arbitrary number of ticks, and will make sure the words == what was recently written

For outputting to the PHY, it's easy: we just pre-load the PHY with a frame and a counter with the number of bytes to transmit; then every second we send out the frame. 

We start out with the counter's lower 10 bits reading bytes from the BlockSelect RAM, and pull TX_EN low when CNT > (FRAMELEN-1) . We reset the counter when CNT=CNTRST; 

For each cycle, we'll toggle the TX LED for the duration of TX_EN. 

RX_DV is tied to the RX LED. 

The Serial interface is configured, but mostly to convince myself that it works. 
Added LEDPOWER with a flasher.
