Assembly / BOM notes:

S588-5999-P3 Gigabit magnetics

This part with the form-factor is very hard to find. The best replacement is the H5007 from Pulse Engineering Inc (www.pulseeng.com).  You can order this at the moment from arrow.com for $8.00 or so. 


27 October 2003 : Ordering Parts
arrow: out of ram, ordered scsi connectors, magnetics (h5007) from them

digikey: FPGA, 

samples: PHY from NS, voltage reg from TI, RJ-45s from molex

Oscillator TS pin is actually an OE pin. Corrected in PCB, sch, and cut trace with xacto on the PCBs i have. 

Soldered on the PHY correctly, as indicated by getting good clock out of the clock out pin.
