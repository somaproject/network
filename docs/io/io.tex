\section{Data Transmission}

There are two signals which govern frame transmission: 

\signal{NEWFRAME}

\signal{DIN[15:0]}

\signal{NEWFRAME} is the clock enable for the data line; the first
transmitted word must be the length of the frame, NOT including the
header packet, in bytes.  Thus this number could be zero.

The most significant byte, \signal{DIN[15:8]}, is transmitted on the
wire first.

Along with each packet, we also transmit a 32-bit CRC at the end,
ethernet frame style.

\subsection{Possible errors}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Continuing to assert \signal{NEWFRAME} after the specified
  number of words have been sent will be ignored.
\item If \signal{NEWFRAME} is deasserted prior to the transmission of the correct number of words, the packet is not committed to the fifo
\end{enumerate}


\section{Data Reception}

There are three signals which govern frame reception: 

\signal{NEXTFRAME}
\signal{DOUTEN}
\signal{DOUT[15:0]}

Assert NEXTFRAME for the duration of a frame you want out.
