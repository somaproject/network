\section{Data Transmission}

There are two signals which govern frame transmission: 

\signal{NEWFRAME}

\signal{DIN[15:0]}

\signal{NEWFRAME} is the clock enable for the data line; the first
transmitted word must be the length of the frame, NOT including the
header packet, in bytes.  Thus this number could be zero.

The most significant byte, \signal{DIN[15:8]}, is transmitted on the
wire first.

Along with each packet, we also transmit a 32-bit CRC at the end,
ethernet frame style. This CRC is included in the packet length
header. In the end, this means that all packets have a length of at
least four. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{timing}{datatx}
C: IOCLK     :  |  |  |   |   |   |   // |       |   |   | 
S: NEWFRAME  :  L  L  H   H   H   H   // H       H   H   L
B: DIN[15:0] :  Z  Z  LEN 0   2   4   // n-2     CRC CRC Z
BC:          :  0  0  2   1   1   1   // 1       2   2   0 
\end{timing}
\caption{Example data transmission to the NIC. Note the length of the
  packet in bytes, including the trailing CRC but not including the
  LEN header, is sent first.} 
\end{figure}

\subsection{Possible errors}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Continuing to assert \signal{NEWFRAME} after the specified
  number of words have been sent will be ignored.
\item If \signal{NEWFRAME} is deasserted prior to the transmission of the correct number of words, the packet is not committed to the fifo
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data Reception}

There are three signals which govern frame reception: 

\signal{NEXTFRAME}: asserted by the host to the NIC to indicate that the host is ready to receive a frame. 

\signal{DOUTEN}: Asserted by the NIC to indicate valid data on the data out lines. 

\signal{DOUT[15:0]}

\begin{figure}
\begin{timing}{datarx}
C: IOCLK      :  |  |   //   |  |   |  |  |  // |   |   |   | |   
S: NEXTFRAME  :  L  H   //   H  H   H  H  H  // H   H   H   H L 
S: DOUTEN     :  L  L   //   L  H   H  H  H  // H   H   H   L L 
B: DOUT[15:0] :  Z  Z   //   Z  LEN 0  2  4  // n-2 CRC CRC Z Z
BC:           :  0  0   //   Z  2   1  1  1  // 1   2   2   0 0
\end{timing}
\caption{Example data reception from the NIC. Note the length of the
  packet in bytes, including the trailing CRC but not including the
  LEN header, is sent first.} 
\end{figure}

The first 16-bit word is the total frame length, not including the
frame length header. The packet is suffixed by a 32-bit crc (same as
TX).
