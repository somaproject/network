The RX Packet FIFO is a single clock-domain interface between the GMII
interface and the rest of the RXInput hardware. It allows the RX Input
module to operate on entire packets at a time. This is also necessary
as we have some per-packet overhead when interfacing with memory, and
we'd like to keep that controlled.
