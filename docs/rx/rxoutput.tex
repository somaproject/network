RX output Notes: 

This appears to be a simple async fifo that transmits a packet to the
downstream interface.

To read the packet out of ram into a buffer, and then transmit, would
incur a very long (~10 us) delay. Instead, at our peril, we just begin
transmitting the packets out of the memory into an async fifo. 

Note that the timing here is tricky. While its true that the memory
interface operates at 62.5 MHz/16-bit-word, and this should be
strictly faster than the output interface (which is constrained to be
< 60) various delays in the system may result in DOUTEN not being high
for the entire duration of the packet.


The assertion of NEXTFRAME by the client means "I am ready for inbound
packets." Once NEXTFRAME is asserted, it should not be deasserted
until DOEN has gone high.
