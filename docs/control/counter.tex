\subsection{Counter}

The counter module is a simple pipelined 32-bit counter for keeping
track of system counters and status. The pipelining should allow it to operate at the full system clock rate of 125 MHz. 

\subsubsection{interface}
The \signal{CNT[31:0]} output increments for each clock-cycyle during which \signal{INC} is asserted. An assertion of \signal{CNTRST} results in \signal{CNT} being reset to zero on the following cycle.
